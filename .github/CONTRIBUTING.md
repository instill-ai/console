# Contributing Guidelines

We appreciate your contribution to this amazing project! Any form of engagement is welcome, including but not limiting to
- feature request
- documentation wording
- bug report
- roadmap suggestion
- ...and so on!

Please refer to the [community contributing section](https://github.com/instill-ai/community#contributing) for more details.

## Current limitations

Due to all the logic of console lies in the [cortex](https://github.com/instill-ai/design-system). And currently the local development workflow had been blocked by several pnpm link issues. 

- [Support peer dependencies when symlinking in development #604](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/604)
- [Saving packages with their dependency set in the store #1001](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/1001)

We have to release RC version in order to sync between console and our cortex while developing locally. But to release RC version require our company's secret key. So it's hard for contributor to correctly set up the local development process.

We will take a close look at the pnpm issue and try to find a workaround for this. 

## Development and codebase contribution

Before delving into the details to come up with your first PR, please familiarise yourself with the project structure of [Instill Core](https://github.com/instill-ai/community#instill-core).

### Sending PRs

Please take these general guidelines into consideration when you are sending a PR:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Begin by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a New Branch:** Create a new branch to house your work. Use a clear and descriptive name, like `<your-github-username>/<what-your-pr-about>`.
3. **Make and Commit Changes:** Implement your changes and commit them. We encourage you to follow these best practices for commits to ensure an efficient review process:
   - Adhere to the [conventional commits guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for meaningful commit messages.
   - Follow the [7 rules of commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for well-structured and informative commits.
   - Rearrange commits to squash trivial changes together, if possible. Utilize [git rebase](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/03/20/reorder-commits-with-rebase.html) for this purpose.
4. **Push to Your Branch:** Push your branch to your GitHub repository: `git push origin feat/<your-feature-name>`.
5. **Open a Pull Request:** Initiate a pull request to our repository. Our team will review your changes and collaborate with you on any necessary refinements.

When you are ready to send a PR, we recommend you to first open a `draft` one. This will trigger a bunch of `tests` [workflows](https://github.com/instill-ai/connector-ai/tree/main/.github/workflows) running a thorough test suite on multiple platforms. After the tests are done and passed, you can now mark the PR `open` to notify the codebase owners to review. We appreciate your endeavour to pass the integration test for your PR to make sure the sanity with respect to the entire scope of **Instill Core**.
