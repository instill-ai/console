## The console of ðŸ”® Instill Core

The console, developed using Nextjs, Typescript, and TailwindCSS, operates in a docker container alongside other **ðŸ”® Instill Core** components. Want to give it a try? Visit the [instill-core](https://github.com/instill-ai/instill-core) repository to run the suite on your local machine.

The primary objective of the console is to offer a unified, streamlined, and user-friendly interface for **ðŸ”® Instill Core**. It allows users to create, manage, and observe pipelines, models, and artifacts directly from their browser.

## Folder structure

- apps: Store all the instill-ai apps
  - console: The Instill AI console APP
- packages: Store all the packages that will be used across instill-ai frontend projects
  - design-system: The base component of all the instill-ai frontend projects
  - design-token: The design-token that unify the style
  - toolkit: All the high level component of instill-ai frontend projects

Normally, we won't touch the components of design-system due to the casualty will be big. Most of our development is centering around the toolkit. And the console only consume the components from toolkit without having its own components.
